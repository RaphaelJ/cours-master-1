The main script can be used to probe the set of the most popular websites.

For example, to probe the 50 most popular websites and to plot the CDF graph in
the file "cdf.eps", execute the following command (as root):

> python2 main.py --cdf-file cdf.eps -n 50

As the script is slow to execute (because of the number of traces to execute and
the default timeout of 2 seconds), it can be executed in parallel, on multiple
websites at the same time, using the "-p" command line parameter.
However, I discourage anyone to use this feature at it seems that Scapy is not
tread-safe.

A second script named "proxy.py" is designed to test the presence of a TCP
proxy.

For example, to test the presence of a proxy when contacting Facebook over HTTP,
use:

> python2 proxy.py facebook.com

Notice that the execution of this scipt takes a few seconds.

Proxy detection can be enabled in the main.py script too using the
"--test-proxy" parameter. It is disabled by default as proxy tests are slow to
execute.

Scapy traces are disabled for both scripts but can be enabled with the
"--verbose" parameter. Complete script usage can be obtained using the "--help"
parameter.
