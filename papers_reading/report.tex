\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{A}{}s of today, the three major regional Internet registries
(APNIC, ARIN \& RIPE) exhausted their respective allocated IPv4 address spaces.
This major event is making the new (yet two decades old) IPv6 protocol adoption
unavoidable. \\
According to Google statistics as March 2014\cite{google:ipv6}, only 3\% of
their users are accessing their services using IPv6. As low as this number is,
it is increasing exponentially, getting a twenty fold improvement since January
2009, which proves that the IPv6 revolution is clearly ongoing. \\
This paper is intended to give an overview of the current state of the IPv6
deployment all along with a summary of the improvements which have been done
for the past ten years. Its primarily based on four sources, 
\cite{paper1}, \cite{paper2}, \cite{paper3} and \cite{paper4}, spanning from
mid-2005 to the end of 2012. \\
Section \ref{primordial} goes through a report of the early stages of the IPv6
adoption.

\section{The primordial IPv6 network}
\label{primordial}

\subsection{A small network}

During the early stages of IPv6, the network was highly sparse and only a few
peering points were available to transmit intercontinental packets. \\
Engineers made a study on the reachability and performance of dual-stack web
servers when contacted from the Chinese Education and Research Network in
2005\cite{paper1}. They noticed that the link to some European countries was
very poor when compared in term of packet loss (see Fig. \ref{fig:packet_loss})
to its IPv4 counterpart. The reason was that most of IPv6 packets going to
Germany (DE), Ireland (IE) or France (FR) were using a restricted set of common
links/tunnels (see \ref{tunnels}) with a very high packet loss rate.

\subsection{Early adopters}

Using machine learning techniques, \cite{paper4} were able to classify ASes by
their owner's type of business. They analyzed IPv6 ASes history from  

\subsection{The initial dominance of IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels}
\label{tunnels}

From the beginning of its deployment up until a few years ago, IPv6 was heavily
relaying on tunnel mechanisms (mostly \textit{6to4} and \textit{Teredo}) to
carry packets between two hosts. \\
This presence of tunnels was, along with the sparsity of the initial mesh, the
main explained cause for smaller average numbers of hops between two hosts found
in IPv6 (8.7 hops versus 17.5 for IPv4) in \cite{paper1} experiments (2005). \\
This is confirmed by \cite{google:ipv6} : until April 2010 most Google IPv6
users were accessing the website using tunnels. \\
The rapid adoption of tunnels was probably propelled by some ISPs\cite{free:6rd}
that provided primitive IPv6 support using automatic tunnel configuration
methods such as the 6to4 anycast prefix\cite{rfc:3068} or the 6rd
mechanism\cite{rfc:5569}.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% \label{fig_sim}
% \end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables

%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.



\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.





% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
